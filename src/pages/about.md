## About Me

Hello! I'm Alejandro Rey, a passionate full-stack developer with a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science
from the University of Málaga.

I've done a Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering course in Google (GSEC Malaga, Spain) and I'm specializing as a
Cybersecurity and DevOps Engineer.

## My Approach

With a strong foundation in both mathematics and computer science, I am skilled in adapting to different technologies
and environments.

As a developer, I’m driven by a deep commitment to excellence.
I approach each project with precision and attention to detail, ensuring that my code is not only functional but also
clean, scalable, and maintainable.
I take pride in applying design patterns and following clean architectures to deliver high-quality, robust applications.

Whether working with front-end technologies like React and Next.js, or back-end frameworks such as PHP Symfony and
Node.js, I am always excited to face new challenges and learn from them.

## Let’s Connect

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaborating on a project or if you’d just like to talk tech. I'm always
open to new opportunities and challenges. You can get in touch with me through my social links at the bottom of the
page.
